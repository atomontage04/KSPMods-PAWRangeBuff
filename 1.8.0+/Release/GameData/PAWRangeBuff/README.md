# PAWRangeBuff
This KSP mod increases the maximum distance at which kerbanauts are able to open Part Action Window menus while being EVA.

The modifier applies to any PAW item, even modded ones (at least it tries to).

The modifier takes into account the largest attach node of the part you right-clicked on. If it thinks that current range is already big enough, no modifier is applied except for the user-defined coefficient (see SETTINGS section). That allows one to manually modify the PAW range for all actions.

## SETTINGS
See `Settings.cfg` in the mod directory.

## INSTALLATION
Just unzip the contents of a release archive to the KSP directory.
